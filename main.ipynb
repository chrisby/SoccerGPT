      "  - Average goals scored per game: 1.88\n",
      "  - Average goals conceded per game: 1.13\n",
      "  - Ball possession: 60.13%\n",
      "  - Clean sheets: 25%\n",
      "  - Key Players: Aleksandar Mitrović (8.14 rating), Sergej Milinković-Savić (7.45 rating), Dušan Tadić (7.7 rating)\n",
      "  - Strengths: High ball possession, consistent goal-scoring, strong attacking presence with Mitrović and Tadić.\n",
      "  - Weaknesses: Conceding goals, especially between minutes 30 and 45.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### England\n",
      "- **Coach**: Gareth Southgate\n",
      "- **Qualification Performance**:\n",
      "  - Average goals scored per game: 2.75\n",
      "  - Average goals conceded per game: 0.5\n",
      "  - Ball possession: 62.5%\n",
      "  - Clean sheets: 50%\n",
      "  - Key Players: Bukayo Saka (7.83 rating), Harry Kane (7.36 rating), Kyle Walker (7.2 rating)\n",
      "  - Strengths: Strong defense, high goal-scoring rate, effective in converting shots on target.\n",
      "  - Weaknesses: Slightly lower ball possession compared to Serbia, but still high.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Justification\n",
      "- **Serbia** has a strong attacking lineup with Mitrović and Tadić, but their defense has shown vulnerabilities, particularly in the latter stages of the first half.\n",
      "- **England** has a more balanced team with a solid defense and a potent attack led by Harry Kane. Their ability to keep clean sheets in 50% of their games and a lower average of goals conceded per game gives them a defensive edge.\n",
      "- **Ball possession** is slightly in favor of England, which could help them control the game.\n",
      "- **Player Ratings**: England's key players have slightly higher average ratings, indicating better individual performances.\n",

      "Based on the provided statistics and performance during the qualification tournament, I predict that **Spain** will win Group B of the 2024 European Championship. Here’s a detailed analysis justifying this prediction:\n",
      "\n",
      "### Spain\n",
      "- **Performance and Consistency**: Spain won 87.5% of their qualification games, the highest win percentage among the teams in Group B. They also earned an average of 2.75 points per game, which is the highest in the group.\n",
      "- **Offensive Strength**: Spain scored 25 goals, averaging 3.13 goals per game, which is significantly higher than the other teams. Their conversion rate of 15.65% and the fact that 37.41% of their shots were on target indicate a highly efficient attack.\n",
      "- **Defensive Solidity**: Spain conceded only 5 goals in total, averaging 0.63 goals per game. They kept a clean sheet in 50% of their games, showing a strong defensive performance.\n",
      "- **Ball Possession and Control**: With an average ball possession of 72.25%, Spain dominated their games, which is crucial for controlling the pace and creating scoring opportunities.\n",
      "- **Discipline**: Despite their aggressive play, Spain maintained discipline with an average of 2 yellow cards per game and 9.75 fouls per game.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Comparison with Other Teams\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Croatia\n",
      "- **Performance**: Croatia earned 2.25 points per game and won 62.5% of their games, which is lower than Spain.\n",
      "- **Offensive and Defensive Stats**: Croatia scored 13 goals (1.63 goals per game) and conceded 4 goals (0.5 goals per game). While their defense is strong, their offensive output is significantly lower than Spain’s.\n",
      "- **Ball Possession**: Croatia had a ball possession of 66.63%, which is good but still lower than Spain’s.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Italy\n",
      "- **Performance**: Italy earned 2 points per game and won 50% of their games. They also had 25% of their games end in a draw, indicating some inconsistency.\n",
      "- **Offensive and Defensive Stats**: Italy scored 16 goals (2 goals per game) and conceded 9 goals (1.13 goals per game). Their defensive record is weaker compared to Spain and Croatia.\n",
      "- **Ball Possession**: Italy had a ball possession of 62.88%, which is lower than both Spain and Croatia.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Albania\n",
      "- **Performance**: Albania earned 2 points per game and won 50% of their games, with 37.5% ending in a draw.\n",
      "- **Offensive and Defensive Stats**: Albania scored 12 goals (1.5 goals per game) and conceded 4 goals (0.5 goals per game). While their defense is solid, their offensive output is the lowest among the teams.\n",
      "- **Ball Possession**: Albania had the lowest ball possession at 50.25%, indicating they were often on the back foot.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Conclusion\n",
      "Spain’s superior offensive and defensive statistics, combined with their high ball possession and consistent performance, make them the strongest contender to win Group B. Their ability to control games and convert opportunities into goals sets them apart from the other teams in the group.\n"
